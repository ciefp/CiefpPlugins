🔹 CiefpKingSat v2.0 – Major UI & Usability Upgrade 🔹

This release represents a major step forward in both usability and visual presentation of the plugin.

Starting from a simple text-based channel listing, CiefpKingSat has evolved into a fully structured, 
table-based browsing experience with consistent layout across all sections.

✅ What’s New in v2.0

• Completely redesigned Satellite Channels screen with tabular layout
• Added column headers (Channel, Country, Category, Package, Encryption)
• Implemented transponder grouping headers for easier frequency overview
• Introduced pagination system (Next / Prev) instead of continuous scrolling
• Unified layout and colors across Satellite, Packages, Channels and News screens
• Packages screen now uses the same table-based channel view
• News screen converted to paged reading mode with Next / Prev & Left / Right support
• Improved fonts, spacing and alignment for better readability
• Clearer encryption display (FTA shown instead of “clear”)
• Better performance and smoother navigation

🎯 Result

CiefpKingSat v2.0 offers a cleaner, faster and more professional user experience, 
bringing the plugin to a much higher visual and functional level compared to previous versions.
