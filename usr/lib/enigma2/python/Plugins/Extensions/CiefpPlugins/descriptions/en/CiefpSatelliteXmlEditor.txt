CiefpSatellitesXmlEditor 

It is used to view and edit the satellites.xml file,
which is used in satellite set-top boxes to define satellites and transponders.

Main plugin functionalities:
Overview of satellites.xml content:
- Displays a list of all satellites with their positions.
- Below each satellite displays all its transponders (frequency, polarization, symbol rate, FEC, system, modulation).
- Additionally displays optional parameters such as Multistream (is_id, pls_code, pls_mode) and T2-MI (t2mi_plp_id, t2mi_pid).

Editing existing transponders:
- Allows you to change all important transponder parameters via the configuration screen.
- Updates values directly in the XML structure.

Adding new transponders:
- Can add a new <transponder> element within the selected satellite.

Deleting elements:
- The "Delete" button allows you to delete a satellite or transponder from the list.

Saving changes:
- When the "Save" button is pressed, the changes are written back to the satellites.xml file.
- The XML file is nicely formatted and contains a comment with the date it was last edited.

User interface:
Two screens:
- Reader – for viewing the entire file.
- Editor – for detailed editing of individual transponders.

Technical implementation:
The plugin is written in Python for the Enigma2 platform.
- It uses xml.etree.ElementTree to work with XML.
- It uses xml.dom.minidom to display XML nicely.
- Parameters such as polarization, FEC, system, etc. are mapped to human-readable names.
- Frequency and symbol rate values are automatically multiplied/divided by 1000 for easier manipulation.
