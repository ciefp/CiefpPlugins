(editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/...)
– now the plugin can load “Best of / Ranked by Tomatometer” categories
(Disney, Marvel, Netflix, genres, years, etc.).

plugin
- Added automatic display of year in the title for editorial lists
(e.g. The Aristocats (1970)).

(Best New Movies, Best by Year, Disney, Marvel, Essential Sci-Fi, Netflix best, etc.).
