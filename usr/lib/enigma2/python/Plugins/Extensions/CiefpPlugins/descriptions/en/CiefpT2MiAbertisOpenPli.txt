CiefpSettings T2MI Abertis OpenPLi

is a customized version for OpenPLi
which enables the installation and configuration of add-ons required for using T2MI and Abertis satellite settings.


Changes in the new version:

Enlarged screen:
Changed screen size from 1200x600 to 1600x800,
adjusted widget positions and sizes (info, status, buttons) and increased font size for better readability.

Local files:
We have removed the download of files from the Internet (except for astra-sm)
and switched to copying files from local directories (data and data/scripts) using shutil.copy.


The plugin automatically installs:
Astra-SM: A tool for handling T2MI signals. (this file is downloaded from the internet)
Configuration files: astra-sm.conf, astra-sm.lua, and sysctl.conf, SoftCam.Key, abertis script (now copied from local directory)
Integration with oscam-emu.
This plugin simplifies the installation process of the necessary components and is tailored 
for users who want to quickly and easily configure OpenPLi for T2MI/Abertis.

Nameserver - DNS settings:
In order for the network to work properly when using a static IP address, it is necessary to manually set DNS servers.

These DNS servers belong to Google and enable reliable resolution of domain names.
This is done through network configuration:
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
Restarting the network: After the changes, be sure to restart the network:

When properly configured, the static IP network works without problems, and the plugin can download the necessary files from the Internet.
