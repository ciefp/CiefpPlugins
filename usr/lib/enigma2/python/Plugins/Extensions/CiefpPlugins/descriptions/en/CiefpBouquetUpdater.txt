What does the plugin do?

CiefpBouquetUpdater enables easy download and update of channel bouquets from GitHub (ciefp-E2-75E-34W).
Users can choose which bouquets they want to install — satellite, themed or IPTV — without losing their existing settings.

How is it used?

1. Start the plugin from the Enigma2 receiver menu.
2. On the left list, choose the bouquets you want (move the arrow up/down, confirm with "OK").
3. Press the green button ("Copy") for temporary copying or the yellow button ("Install") for installation.
4. Wait for the installation to finish — the receiver will automatically refresh.

What's special?
• Selective installation: Install only the bouquets you want, not the entire list.
• Preserves user bouquets: Your personal bouquets remain intact — old files are only deleted if they overlap with newly selected bouquets.
• Name display: Instead of technical file names, you see the actual names of the bouquets (eg "•• 16.0 E - Max TV ••") according to the order from bouquets.tv.
• Quick and easy: Ideal for all users, from beginners to advanced users.

Who is it intended for?
This plugin is perfect for those who want the flexibility to update specific channel bouquets while keeping their custom lists on Enigma2 receivers.
