CiefpSettingsMotor Plugin 

What does the plugin do?
CiefpSettingsMotor is a simple tool that downloads, unpacks and installs the latest channel list for motorized satellite dishes
directly from GitHub (ciefp-E2-75E-34W). This list includes satellite bouquets (eg 19.2E, 16.0E, 13.0E...),
thematic bouquets (sport, movies, music), IPTV channels and markers, adapted for a wide range of satellite positions.

How is it used?
1. Start the plugin from the Enigma2 receiver menu.
2. Press "OK" on the remote control.
3. Wait for the list to download and install — the process is automatic and only takes a few moments.
4. After installation, the receiver will automatically refresh and the new list will be active.

What's new in version 2.2?
• Saves user bouquets: Your personally created bouquets (eg userbouquet.moje_favorite.tv) will not be deleted.
 The plugin keeps them and places them at the end of the list in bouquets.tv, while new satellite, thematic and IPTV bouquets are added to the top.
• Complete installation: All files from the list (lamedb, .tv, .radio) are copied to /etc/enigma2/,
 and satellites.xml in /etc/tuxbox/, ensuring full up-to-dateness.
• Simplicity: No complicated settings — everything works with one click.

Who is it intended for?
This plugin is ideal for users with motorized antennas who want an updated channel list without losing their custom settings.
Whether you are a beginner or an experienced user, installation is quick and easy.
