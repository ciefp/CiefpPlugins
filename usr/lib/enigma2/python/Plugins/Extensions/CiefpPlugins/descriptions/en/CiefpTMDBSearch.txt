📊 CiefpTMDBSearch 2.1

The new gallery is easy to use. Here's a quick guide:

Access to the gallery:
After loading the movie or series data, press the MENU button on the remote control.
In the menu, select the option 🖼️ Backdrop Gallery or 🎬 Poster Gallery.

Navigation through the gallery:
Use the YELLOW and BLUE buttons (or left/right arrows) to move through the images.

The GREEN button returns you to the home screen or switches between the backdrop and poster gallery (if possible).
The status line at the top shows which image you are out of a total of how many (eg, "6/185").

Closing the gallery:
Press the RED button or OK/Exit to return to the main plugin screen.

💡 Tips and notes
Caching: Images are automatically downloaded and saved to your selected cache folder (set in Settings). This speeds up the display the next time you open it.
Setting the language: In Settings, you can change the language for the descriptions. This also affects the language of the data you receive from the TMDB database.
Performance: If the plugin starts working slower due to a full cache, you can clear it via MENU > More Options > 🗑️ Clear Cache.
The new gallery is a great addition that provides users with a full experience of viewing the visual content of a movie or series.
