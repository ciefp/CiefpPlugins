⏱ Time synchronization
- CH+ / CH- → Manually move subtitle time (fine sync forward / backward)

💡 Note on EPG time
On some channels, the EPG may deviate by a few minutes from the actual broadcast.
This depends on the channel/operator itself and is not related to the plugin.
The plugin uses the real playback time when available, and the EPG only as an auxiliary reference.

✅ Note
The plugin no longer saves the previous subtitle file in the settings.
After starting, a new file must be selected.
