CiefpTvProgramSK is an Enigma2 plugin designed to display the Electronic Program Guide (EPG) for TV channels,
using data downloaded from https://epgshare01.online/epgshare01/epg_ripper_SK1.xml.gz.
The plugin allows users to view the channel list and detailed EPG information, including show names, broadcast times, descriptions and categories.
It supports the display of picons (channel icons), plugin logos and background graphics, with data caching for faster loading.
The interface is intuitive, with navigation between the channel list and EPG information, and is adapted for the Enigma2 platform.

Using the plugin

Navigation:
Channel list: The left side of the screen displays a list of available channels downloaded from an XML file.
EPG information: The right side displays program details for the selected channel (time, title, description, category).
Use the Up/Down keys to navigate through the channel list or EPG information, depending on the current focus.
Press OK to switch focus between the channel list and EPG information.
Press Cancel (or Exit) to exit the plugin.
Functionalities:
Picon display: The icon of the selected channel is displayed at the bottom of the screen if available in the folder 
/usr/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/Extensions/CiefpTvProgramSK/picon.
If the icon is not found, the default icon (placeholder.png) is used.
Data caching: EPG data is cached in /tmp/CiefpProgramSK/epg_cache.xml for 24 hours to reduce data downloads.
Logging: The plugin logs activities and errors in the file /tmp/ciefp_tvprogramsk.log for diagnostics.
