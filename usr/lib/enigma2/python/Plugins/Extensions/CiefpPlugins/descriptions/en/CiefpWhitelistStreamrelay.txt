CiefpWhitelistStreamrelay is a plugin for Enigma2 receivers, designed for automated generation of
`whitelist_streamrelay` file using data from predefined userbouquet files.

Main functionalities:

information about streams.

- Packages supported SKYDE 19.0E - SKYUK 28.2E.

2. Display information to user:

3. Restart Enigma2:
- After the file generation is complete, the user has the option to confirm restart Enigma2 to load the new settings.
- Restart is performed only after the user presses OK on the remote control.
