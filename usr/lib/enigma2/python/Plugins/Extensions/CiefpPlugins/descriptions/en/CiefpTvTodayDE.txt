CiefpTvTodayDE

CiefpTvTodayDE is an Enigma2 plugin for displaying EPG (Electronic Program Guide) data for TV channels,
customized for users in Germany. The plugin downloads EPG data from epgshare01.online,
caches it locally and displays the programs for each channel, along with the corresponding pictograms (channel logos).
The interface allows easy browsing of channels and their programs, with focus on the current or next program.

Display of a list of channels and their EPG data (time, title, category, description).
Automatic downloading and caching of EPG data (24-hour cache).
Display of pictograms for channels, with fallback to a placeholder pictogram if a pictogram is missing.
Intuitive interface with a selection bar that automatically marks the current or next program.
Support for navigation using the OK, UP, DOWN and EXIT keys.
Logging only critical errors and missing pictograms in /tmp/ciefp_epgshare.log.
