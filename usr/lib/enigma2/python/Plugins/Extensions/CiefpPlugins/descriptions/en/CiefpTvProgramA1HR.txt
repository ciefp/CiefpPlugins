CiefpTvProgramA1HR is an Enigma2 plugin for displaying EPG (Electronic Program Guide) data for TV channels,
customized for users in Croatia (A1HR). The plugin downloads EPG data from epgshare01.online,
caches it locally and displays programs for each channel, along with the corresponding pictograms (channel logos).
The interface allows easy browsing of channels and their programs, with focus on the current or next program.
